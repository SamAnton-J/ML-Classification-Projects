# **Machine Learning Classification Models Comparison**

This repository contains a collection of classification models implemented in Python, including:

## **Models Implemented**

- **Decision Tree**
- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**
- **Logistic Regression**
- **Naive Bayes**
- **Random Forest**
- **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**

## **Project Overview**

This project aims to compare the performance of different classification models on various datasets. The goal is to evaluate the **strengths and weaknesses** of each model and provide **insights into when to use each model**. By analyzing the results, you'll gain a better understanding of which algorithms are most effective for different types of classification problems.
